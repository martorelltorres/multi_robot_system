# 1 Split the tasks depending of the number of robots
# 2 Assign non consecutive random tasks

task_allocation: 1


# 1 -->  Divide the tasks between the number of robots and assign tasks to each robot
#       example:Tasks [0,1,2,3,4]-> r1_tasks[0,1,2], r2_tasks[3,4]

# 2 --> Assign the nearest polygon to the robot_0, and decide wich is the task for the robot_1. Tasks mustn't be consecutive.
        # example:Tasks [0,1,2,3,4]-> r1_tasks[3,4,0], r2_tasks[1,2]
